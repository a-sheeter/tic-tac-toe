# tic-tac-toe
C++ program simulating a game of tic-tac-toe

This was a project completed through Codecademy where the challenge was to create a game of tic-tac-toe between two players using for or while loops, vectors and functions. 

The code is organized into three files -- the main .cpp file, a functions.cpp file and a functions.hpp header file.
